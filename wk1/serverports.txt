1. What is the definition of a server port?
A server port is a logical communication endpoint in a network that allows a server to provide a specific service. It is associated with a specific process or application and is identified by a unique number. For example, port 80 is commonly used for HTTP services.



2. What is the server port range?
The range of server ports is defined by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and is categorized into three ranges:

Well-Known Ports: 0 to 1023 (reserved for system services and protocols, e.g., HTTP, FTP).
Registered Ports: 1024 to 49151 (assigned to user processes or applications, e.g., databases, custom apps).
Dynamic/Private Ports: 49152 to 65535 (used for temporary communication, also called ephemeral ports).





3. How many bits does the number above represent?
A port number is represented using 16 bits (2 bytes), allowing values from 0 to 65535.



4. State 10 common server ports.

Port 20/21: FTP (File Transfer Protocol) - Data transfer and control.
Port 22: SSH (Secure Shell) - Secure remote access.
Port 23: Telnet - Unsecured text-based communication.
Port 25: SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) - Sending emails.
Port 53: DNS (Domain Name System) - Resolving domain names to IPs.

Port 110: POP3 (Post Office Protocol v3) - Retrieving emails.
Port 143: IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) - Accessing emails.
Port 443: HTTPS (HTTP Secure) - Secure web browsing.
